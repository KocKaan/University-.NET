# Karakas University

This project is written to imitate a professional standard backend architecture.
Karakas University is a application that allows student to register to classes and
view their grades for their respective classes. The framework thats been used is
**.NET MVC** and **SOLID principles** were used. Its possible to find specific examples
to show the application of SOLID principles. Service layer is created in addition
and Data Transfer Object (DTO) is used to create communication between Database
and the Service Layer. There is no automapper for DTO therefore the data is put
on and taken off by DTO's manually. The unit testing is not extensive but utilizes
concepts like mocking. Trivial applications of data security is applied. Open
for further development.
